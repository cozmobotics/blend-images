# blendPics

## Overview

blendPics creates a slide show of images with smooth and/or interesting transition between images

Available as screensaver (NEW!) and standalone application

An example output is here: https://youtu.be/OLZAuHpUXRo

It is a console application which needs a little computer knowledge to use it. 

## Features:

* some transition types available. Try them out!
* Optionally dig into subdirectories,
* complex sorting methods available
* Optionally random-shuffle images, "mild shuffling" available
* Optionally loop through files, 
* Optionlly filter protrait or landscape images (for nicer transitions)
* Copy current path+filename to clipboard, 
* move back and forward, timed or on keypress, 
* filter portrait or landscape images, filter newest files, add custom filter (regex)
* optionally read list of pictures from file 
* stop transition to see "the third image"
* No Ken Burns Effect (because I hate it)
* play videos (with external player)
* optionally write to video (experimental)
* comiled or interpreted (python) version available 
* no installation, just run the program (compiled version)
* leaves no trace on your PC
* optionally disable screensaver while show is running (Windows only)
* optionally leave screen black after last picture, wait for keypress

Tested under Windows 10. As Python and its libraries are cross-platform, the program should run under any other operating system as well. 

## how to get bledPics

As with most open source programs, you may download a compiled executable or get the source. 

### Download the executable
Download executable for Windows here, if you trust me: http://martinpi.at/games/utils/blendPics.exe and http://martinpi.at/games/utils/blendPicsScr.exe (it is too large for GitHub). I did my virus check with Avira. As with any download, please do your own virus-check. 

### use the source
In this repository you find the necessary files to use the python interpreter or compile from source. 

Written in Python3, using opencv 2. You will have to install some other libraries like exif. 

I compiled with [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) / pyinstaller. There is Windows batch to compile and write the compile time into the executable. 

## Details

It started as an excercise in the [tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html "Arithmetic Operations")

It is a console application which needs a little computer knowledge to use it. I suggest to put a batch file onto your desktop which calls blendPics like you prefer to use it, so you can drag a folder onto the batch to start the slideshow. Instructional video (in German) is here: https://youtu.be/I6BX8PdTSBU 

For installing the screensaver, see the comments in blendPicsScr.py 

__Although it is a console application, all keyboard input goes to the graphical window which must have the focus. The console window is for information only.__

## Bugs and limitations
* Works well under Windows, problem with detecting screen size under Linux
* No sound (music etc). 
* White line on top and left margin when running in full-screen
* No error detection when video is not writable (e.g. disk full)
* Todo's: see program code
* Screensaver's search directory is hard-coded to userdir/Pictures, configuration dialog is not yet implemented
